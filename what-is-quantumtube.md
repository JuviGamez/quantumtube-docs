# What is QuantumTube?

QuantumTube is a YouTube frontend designed with privacy and user experience at its core. Unlike the standard YouTube platform, which collects and stores vast amounts of user data on external servers, QuantumTube ensures all your data, including subscriptions, liked videos, and watch history, remains securely stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This approach eliminates the need to rely on third-party servers, like Google’s, giving you complete control over your information.

The interface is sleek and modern, arguably offering a cleaner and more visually appealing experience compared to the traditional YouTube layout. It’s optimized for simplicity and usability, making it easy to navigate without unnecessary clutter. Plus, QuantumTube is entirely ad-free, ensuring an uninterrupted viewing experience free from intrusive advertisements and tracking scripts.

Whether you're using the web version or the Linux desktop application, QuantumTube delivers a fast, lightweight, and private alternative to YouTube, making it an excellent choice for those who value their privacy without compromising on functionality or design.
